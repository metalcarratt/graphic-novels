    <h1>In the camp of the enemy</h1>
    <p>
        Xing Ying crept closer to the campsite. It was full of laughing men, 
        drinking and acting crazy.

        The more she watched the more she was sure they were responsible for 
        what happened to her village.

        Xing Ying couldn't control her anger anymore. She lept out at one 
        small group sitting around a campfire...

        Over the past few weeks her strength and agility and become almost 
        super human. Xing Ying didn't know why, but she found it easy to take 
        down the few men at this part of the camp, despite them being many 
        times her height and weight

    <p>
        Xing Ying calmed down after taking out her anger. She remembered why 
        she came here - to find her mother. Leaving the beaten up men she 
        continued creeping through the camp...

        The camp was almost completely unguarded. Everyone was drinking and 
        partying. Xing Ying looked in one tent and found something that shocked 
        her - the jade stones she had found in the mountains.
    </p>

    <p>
        Xing Ying felt guilty. Did the men attack her village because of her? 
        Because the jade stones were too precious? Xing Ying suddenly felt what 
        had looked like a blessing might have actually been a curse...

        Deeper in the camp Xing Ying found some bamboo cages. She almost couldn't 
        hold back her emotion when, in one of the cages, she found her mother!
