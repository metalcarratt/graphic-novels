    <h1>A poor mountain girl</h1>
    <p>
        Xing Ying lived in a poor mountainous village.
        She was the only daughter of her widowed mother
        and had to scavenge to help make ends meet.

        She joined the other girls in her village transporting
        water from the mountins.

        It was a difficult job but Xing Ying was used to it.

        When they had finished ferrying water for the day the girls
        would go exploring higher up in the mountains.

        They hoped to find something precious they could sell back in the
        village to help give their families a somewhat better life.

        The girls climbed treacherous paths and explored abandoned caves
        hoping to find something of value to sell.

        Some caves were tunnels to other places and had lighted lanterns.

        In other caves the girls brought candles of their own to help them see in the dark.

    <p>
        One day Xing Ying found a cave she hadn't explored before.
        She was all alone and felt apprehensive, but she gathered
        her courage and went inside.
    </p>

    <p>
        The entrance to the cave was small and secluded, but the
        deeper Xing Ying went the larger the cave became. She had
        to keep looking back to remember the way out of the cave.
        She didn't want to get lost in here.
    </p>

    <p>
        As she was walking Xing Ying suddenly saw a bright green light.
        She was surprised to find a vein of bio luminescent jade glowing
        in the rock wall.

    <p>
        Searching through pieces of jade to find the best ones she came
        across one which appeared to have a white flame burning inside it.
        The dance of the flame left her entranced as she silently gazed at it.
