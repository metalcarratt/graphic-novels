        The flame burst forth from the jade, as if it had a mind of its own. 
        It formed wisps of smoke that danced around Xing Ying as she looked 
        at it in wonder.

        The smoke formed hundreds of threads that danced around Xing Ying, 
        making her feel confused and drowsy. They entered her hears and nose 
        and mouth and when the last bit of smoke faded away she fell unconscious.

        Xing Ying woke some time later, her mind foggy. All around her were bits 
        of valuable jade rock. Xing Ying quickly gathered as much as she could 
        carry and left the cave to return home.

        Xing Ying returned to the village with the jade she had found.

        Her mother was so excited. She took it to the market and started selling 
        it for lots of money. The mother and daughter's future started to look bright.

        Over the next few days Xing Ying was amazed at herself. She could run faster 
        than before, lift rocks heavier than herself, and climb dangerous mountains 
        with ease.

        Her stamina had improved and she rarely felt tired.

        She climbed higher mountains and searched deeper into caves, all the time looking 
        for more of the precious jade that had brought such blessing to her family.

        One day she exited a cave and stood on a mountain looking at her village below. 
        She was surprised. The sky had turned red and the village below was white with smoke...

        Xing Ying was stunned as she looked at her home burning in flames. 
        After some time she woke from her shock and one thought burned in the back of her head...
