    <p>
        Xing Ying raced down into the village to look for her mum.

        Everywhere building were on fire and rubble filled the streets.

        Streets she once knew, shops she once frequented. Everywhere
        she turned were the places of her memories; blackened like ash; 
        burning with fire.
    </p>

    <p>
        Xing Ying finally reached her home but all that was left was rubble.
    </p>

    <p>
        No signs of her mother could be found anywhere.
    </p>

    <p>
        Xing Ying didn't know what to do. She had always been poor, but she had 
        always had her mother. Now she didn't know what had happened to her. She 
        didn't know why any of this had happened. The world around her was empty.
    </p>

    <p>
        A long time later Xing Ying picked herself up. I'll achieve nothing by 
        crying, she told herself. She began to wander the streets, looking for 
        clues for what had happened. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Xing Ying followed what clues she could find, which led her to a nearby forest.
    </p>

    <p>
        The clues led her deeper within the forest. She climbed over tree roots and hid 
        behind trees as she tried her best to track the movements of the people who had 
        left the village.
    </p>

    <p>
        Night fell but Xing Ying didn't give up. In the distance she could hear the cry of 
        wanton laughter and jeering.
    </p>

    <p>
        Finally, after hours of walking, she reached the edges of a makeshift camp. The 
        laughter and jeering camp from within.
    </p>

    <p>
        Xing Ying grit her teeth as she stepped closer to the noisy campsite.
