        camp, she couldn't bury her mother. The best she could think 
        to do was to burn the prison that had been the last place her 
        mother had seen when she was alive.`},

    she could hear the sounds of shouting as the men who took her mother's 
    life realised that their camp was on fire. Xing Ying didn't care. 
    Her heart was already cold.`},
